# Hello World Collection 🌍

A comprehensive collection of "Hello World" programs written in various programming languages. This repository serves as a reference for learning different programming languages and their basic syntax.

## 📚 Purpose

This project aims to:

- Demonstrate the basic syntax of different programming languages
- Provide a quick reference for "Hello World" implementations
- Help developers understand language-specific conventions
- Serve as a starting point for learning new programming languages

## 🚀 Getting Started

Each language has its own file with a simple "Hello World" program. You can:

1. **Browse** through different languages to see their syntax
2. **Run** the programs to see them in action
3. **Compare** how different languages handle the same basic task
4. **Learn** from the comments and structure of each implementation

## 📁 Project Structure

```
hello-world/
├── README.md           # This file
├── hello.js            # JavaScript implementation
├── hello.py            # Python implementation
├── hello.go            # Go implementation
├── hello.java          # Java implementation
├── hello.rs            # Rust implementation
├── hello.c             # C implementation
├── hello.cpp           # C++ implementation
└── ... (more languages)
```

## 🛠️ How to Run

### Prerequisites

- Install the specific language runtime/compiler for the language you want to run
- Follow the instructions in each language's directory

### Running Examples

**JavaScript (Node.js):**

```bash
node hello.js
```

**Python:**

```bash
python hello.py
```

**Java:**

```bash
javac Hello.java
java Hello
```

**Go:**

```bash
go run hello.go
```

**Rust:**

```bash
rustc hello.rs
./hello
```

## 📝 Contributing

We welcome contributions! Here's how you can help:

1. **Add new languages** - Submit implementations in languages not yet covered
2. **Improve existing code** - Enhance readability, add comments, or optimize
3. **Fix issues** - Report bugs or submit fixes
4. **Update documentation** - Improve explanations or add more details

### Guidelines for Contributions

- Keep implementations simple and focused on "Hello World"
- Include comments explaining language-specific features
- Follow the language's conventional coding style
- Test your code before submitting
- Update this README if adding new languages
